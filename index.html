                    My name is <b>Julian Krese</b> and I am a rising third-year at the 
                    <b>University of Virginia</b>. I am majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> with a 
                    minor in <b>Data Science</b> and am an aspiring Software Engineer. I am a 
                    perfectionist and highly value the quality of my work, always going above and 
                    beyond to make sure the result is exceptional. I am also a curious and quick learner 
                    by nature; I need to know how and why things work, not just that they work. 
                    Although I don't have any professional Software Development experience yet, I have 
                    experience in related fields and am looking to add Software Developement to that 
                    list.

                    I love being outside and will go outside any chance I get. I am an especially 
                    avid fly fisherman, but also love to hike, swim, go on runs, or anything else 
                    you could name outside. I also enjoy playing soccer and golf, along with other 
                    sports but those are my forte (maybe not so much golf). Along with playing 
                    sports I enjoy watching sports, with golf being my favorite. I also really 
                    enjoy watching movies, with my current two favorite directors being Hayao 
                    Miyazaki and Wes Anderson.
